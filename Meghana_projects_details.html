				<h4 class = "date">02/2021 - 06/2021</h4>
				<p>Developed a remote controlled device which sanitises the area. This device has a UV ligit emitter LED which kills germs with an efficiency of 99.9%. This can be especially useful for sanitising the hospitals nearby COVID affected persons.</p>
				<p><b>Working : </b>The device is operated with the help of a remote. It can move forward, backwards and sideways as well. Remote controlled UV light emitter is used. To sanitise the place UV light emitter button is hit, so that light falls on the area and kills germs.</p><br>
				<p><b>Tools used : </b>Arduino UNO, LED(UV light), DC motors, WI-FI module, python.</p>

				<img src = "Bolt project image.png" class = "right for_image" height = "200" width = "200">
				<h4 class = "date">09/2019 - 12/2019</h4>
				<p class = "left_align">Developed this device to measure the intensity of light. Very useful in places where the sunlight is very less but still wanted to plant trees at those places. </p>
				<p class = "left_align"><b>Working : </b>The value of the resistance changes inversely with the amount of incident light. When the light intensity is high, the resistance is low and vice versa. By linking this device to the Bolt WI-FI module, information is collected at regular intervals of time. Thus we can know which area support plant growth. </p><br>
				<p class = "left_align"><b>Tools used : </b>Bolt WI-FI module, Python, Light Dependent Resistor(LDR).</p>

				<img src = "Temperature measure image.png" class = "left for_image" height = "200" width = "200">
				<h4 class = "date">06/2019 - 07/2019</h4>
				<p>This device has been developed to determine the temperature of the surrounding environment.</p>
				<p><b>Working : </b>Let's take the case of some medicine manufacturing unit where medicines require some standard temperature range, beyond which the medicines become toxic and leads to loss for the company. This device detects the temperature of the surroundings with the help of a sensor and checks if the temperature is within the specified range. If any abnormalities is detected then an immediate alert warning is sent to registered mobile numbers(of all the registered users). Thus, an immediate action is taken and risk of loss is minimized.</p><br>
